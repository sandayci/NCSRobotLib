# Target Acquisition and Obstacle Avoidance

Combines target acquisition and obstacle avoidance on the PushBot.

Based on previous work from Michel Frising.

## Installation

When cloning the repository, don't forget `--recursive` to include the submodule.

    git clone --recursive https://code.ini.uzh.ch/semesterproject_hermann_and_alexander/Pushbot_Remote_Control.git
    cd Pushbot_Remote_Control
    
If you have forgotten the `--recursive` switch it's not the end of the world,
you have to init and update the submodule by hand

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
